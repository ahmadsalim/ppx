# ppx

`ppx` is a cross-platform [**p**robabilistic **p**rogramming](http://www.probabilistic-programming.org) e**x**ecution protocol and API based on [flatbuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/).

Probabilistic programming is about the execution probabilistic models under the control of inference engines, and `ppx` allows the model and the inference engine
* to be implemented in different programming languages and
* to run in separate processes and on separate machines across networks.
